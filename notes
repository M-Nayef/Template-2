[1] on image boxes:
     position :absolute
     when i put top 100% then bottom:0 on hover it doesn't work !
[2] Position :relative :
     give the element z-index :auto which means the last element in html will 
     be on the top (biggest z-index layer)
[3] flex:
     align-items:(by default) streatch => if thers is img the dimention will missed up 
     to avoid this problem use align-items:center
